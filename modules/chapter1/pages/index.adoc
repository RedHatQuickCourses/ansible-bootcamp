= Tested Topologies for AAP 2.6

Red Hat provides a set of tested and supported topologies for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 to offer users opinionated deployment options. These models are designed to ensure that all platform features and capabilities are available immediately upon deployment without requiring additional configuration. By using these reference architectures, organizations can align their installation with their specific infrastructure and organizational needs:

The deployment models are categorized into two primary types based on scale and reliability:

- *Enterprise Topologies*: Designed for production environments, these models emphasize redundancy, high uptime, performance, and continued scalability

- *Growth Topologies*: Tailored for organizations that are resource-constrained or just getting started, these models provide a smaller footprint without built-in redundancy

These topologies are available across three main installation modes: Containers (using Podman on RHEL), Operator (on Red Hat OpenShift), and RPM (on RHEL)
  
Note
 The RPM installer is scheduled for removal in version 2.7, though it remains supported in version 2.6 to facilitate migrations.

**Learning Objectives**

By studying and implementing these deployment models, you will be able to:

- Select the appropriate deployment mode (Container, Operator, or RPM) based on whether your environment utilizes virtual machines, bare metal, or OpenShift Container Platform

- Identify the specific infrastructure requirements for your chosen topology and Differentiate between Growth and Enterprise topologies to determine which configuration meets your organizational requirements for redundancy and volume of automation

- Execute a platform installation using provided configuration templates, such as example inventory files for RHEL-based deployments or Custom Resource (CR) files for OpenShift-based deployments

- Understand the role of Automation Mesh, including how to distribute automation work across a network of execution and hop nodes through peer-to-peer connections
